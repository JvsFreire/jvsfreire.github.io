DESCRIPTION:

Scyber is a Creative Agency. This website is designed in a dark theme, with 
features like fullscreen header/hero section, a nice portfolio section and much more. 
The template is primarily designed for creative agencies but it is versatile enough 
to be used for other purposes like a landing page for your startup or business website.
